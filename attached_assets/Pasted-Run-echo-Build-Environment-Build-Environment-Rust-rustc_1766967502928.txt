versions that meet the requirements `^2.2.1` (locked to 2.4.0) are: 2.4.0

the package `solana-loader-v3-interface` depends on `solana-pubkey`, with features: `solana-sha256-hasher` but `solana-pubkey` does not have these features.
 It has an optional dependency with that name, but that dependency uses the "dep:" syntax in the features table, so it does not have an implicit feature with that name.
