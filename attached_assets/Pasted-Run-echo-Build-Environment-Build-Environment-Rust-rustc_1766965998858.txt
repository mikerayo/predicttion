versions that meet the requirements `^2.2.2` (locked to 2.2.2) are: 2.2.2
the package `solana-program` depends on `solana-address-lookup-table-interface`, with features: `solana-instruction` but `solana-address-lookup-table-interface` does not have these features.
 It has an optional dependency with that name, but that dependency uses the "dep:" syntax in the features table, so it does not have an implicit feature with that name.
